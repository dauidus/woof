# Plugin Screenshots

This folder contains all of the screenshots that have been shipped with _Subtitles_ on [WordPress.org](http://wordpress.org/plugins/subtitles/screenshots/). It's not included in official plugin downloads or updates, but I've added it into this GitHub project to keep track of all plugin screenshots. To learn more about how screenshots are used in official WordPress.org plugins, see this [announcement post](http://make.wordpress.org/core/2012/07/04/fun-with-high-dpi-displays/) about current screenshot sizing.

`banner-1544x500.png` and `banner-772x250.png` are identical in appearance and are used as the plugin header image on WordPress.org. This is also the same image that's used for `screenshot-2.png`.

`screenshot-1.png` is a screenshot showing what the subtitle input fields look like from within a new post or page screen.
